                        <h3>Description</h3>
                                <p>Text classification and clustering form an integral part of analysing text data. In most business scenarios, it is important to analyse the text as a whole and as part of certain subgroups, which might not be apparent from simple frequency analysis. This is where clustering becomes necessary. Text Clustering helps one identify the underlying themes in text data, while also suggesting the number of themes that might be present in the data.</p>
								<p>Text Classification, on the other hand, deals with predicting the category of text data. While sentiment analysis, is one kind of text analytics, it might not be enough in scenarios where the data belongs to more than 2-3 categories, or in scenarios where the text needs to be grouped based on the product/company the text talks about.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Learning Objective</h3>
                                <p>This course is designed to equip a learner with all the necessary concepts and skills required to cluster and classify text data, while also validating if the model is a good fit using training-validation sets.<p>
								The course is divided into two modules. <br>
								<p>First module will cover the concepts and techniques required for 'clustering' text data. The learner will acquire hands on experiences through a real business case prepared with real data. This module  also has a downloadable reading content and four self assessment quizzes.</p>
								<p>Second module has five simulations (real business cases with real data), six quizzes, and one real business case exercise with real data for self assessment. It covers the concepts of ‘Text Classification' using various algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Trees, SVM and SLDA. The module also teaches about cross validating the classification model and the techniques used to reduce overfitting.</p>

                                <p>Analyttica TreasureHunt presents a bouquet of courses designed for individuals who want to learn the art of analysing time series data. This course, the first one in the series, introduces the learner to the concept of time series data and basic analysis with this data. The techniques discussed in this course are the building blocks of time series analysis and makes an individual ready for further exploration of various high end techniques of time series forecasting.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Learning Objective</h3>
                                <p>Structured in 3 modules and 6 real life business cases, the learner is given a hands-on exposure to various basic analysis ranging from visualisation using time series plots and smoothing, to analysing seasonal components and removing trends. The course also introduces the concept of auto-correlation function and partial auto-correlation function, a major tool for time series forecasting.</p>
                        <h3>Course Prerequisite</h3>
								<p>There is no specific pre-requisite for this course. But prior understanding of various data types along with univariate and bivariate measures, will make the learning more effective. The learner may use any online sources for the same, or refer to Analyttica TreasureHunt’s full-fledged courses on fundamental analytical concepts (called “Fundamentals of Data Analytics” on ATH). Feel free to go ahead and explore the courses for a solid foundation in data sciences.</p>
